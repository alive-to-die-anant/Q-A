Question: Yii2:-Pretty URL's are formed, but not working (says 404 NOT FOUND)

I have started learning yii2 and I tried to do pretty URL stuff but failed. What I did:-

**in config/web.php (I have edited below):**

    'urlManager' => [
            'class' => 'yii\web\UrlManager',
            // Hide index.php
            'showScriptName' => false,
            // Use pretty URLs
            'enablePrettyUrl' => true,
            'rules' => [
            ],

*** Then I created a `.htaccess` file and put it on the root (it has the below code):***

    RewriteEngine on
    
    # if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    
    # otherwise forward it to index.php
    RewriteRule . index.php


**Also I had opened apache2.conf file and changed like this:**

    <Directory /var/www/>
    	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    	AllowOverride All <! -- instead of none -->
    	Require all granted
    </Directory>

***Also I checked the changes through the command:***

     grep -R AllowOverride /etc/apache2

***And it shows like below:***

    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:	AllowOverride All  <!-- It is showing that done -->

**Now:**

***when I access my page through:***

http://localhost/yii2/web/

it's opened and when I hover over any link on the page, it shows me something like this: http://localhost/yii2/web/site/about (which shows that pretty URLs are made)

But these URLs are not working (says 404 found)

***I tried below code links answers also but didn't work for me:***

Answer:

*Finally I made it working:-*

***1.*** *created two .htaccess file (one on root and one in web folder of my application):-*

*root .htaccess:-*

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        Options +FollowSymlinks
        RewriteEngine On
    </IfModule>
    
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/.*
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ web/$1 [L]
    
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/web/
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f [OR]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^.*$ web/index.php
    </IfModule> 

*web folder .htaccess:-*

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . index.php

***2.*** *Made below changes in `config/web.php` file :-*

    'urlManager' => [
    	    'enablePrettyUrl' => true,
    	    'showScriptName' => false,
    	    'rules' => [
    		// Your rules here
    	    ],
    	],


***3.*** *Changes needs to be done in `apache2.conf` file:*

    <Directory /var/www/html/>
    	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    	AllowOverride All
    	Require all granted
    </Directory>


***4.*** *Now run the below commands:-*

**a.** *`sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop`* *(to stop apache)*

**b.** *`sudo killall apache2`* *(to kill process)*

**c.** *`sudo netstat -l|grep www`* *(to check port 80 is not in use)*

**d.** *`sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`*  *(restart apache)*



*And now everything worked fine.*

***My sincere Thanks*** to every-one who tried to help me out.
